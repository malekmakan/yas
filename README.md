# YAS
Yet Another Shortener in .NET

## What is it ?
A simple .NET web api compatible with SQL Server and Redis as backend database and using advantages of Javascript as client side application.

Client application is plain js to make a single page application framework from scratch and also I included backend project with a fair design pattern.

## What is next?
1. some unit test around functional sections
2. make comments reacher
3. performance and query logging
4. better UI
